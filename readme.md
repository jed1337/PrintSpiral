# PrintSpiral

## Description
This is a small program that intends to print a spiral using ascending integers
that circles around the bounds of the matrix in a clockwise fashion.

No checkers for valid types were performed: the program will crash if a non-integer value is given.

## Input
The height and width of the matrix.

## Sample output:
### Width: 4, Height: 8
[1, 2, 3, 4]  
[20, 21, 22, 5]  
[19, 32, 23, 6]  
[18, 31, 24, 7]  
[17, 30, 25, 8]  
[16, 29, 26, 9]  
[15, 28, 27, 10]  
[14, 13, 12, 11]  

### Width: 5, Height: 5
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
[16, 17, 18, 19, 6]  
[15, 24, 25, 20, 7]  
[14, 23, 22, 21, 8]  
[13, 12, 11, 10, 9]
